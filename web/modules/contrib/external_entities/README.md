# External Entities

This module allow you to connect to and use datasets from external databases in
your Drupal website. While content lives externally, Drupal sees those remote
entities as internal. This makes it possible to alter the field displays, add
references, comments, path aliases, share buttons, web-shop products and more.

For a full description of the module, visit the 
[project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/external_entities).
